Hi!
Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. 
The _best way_ to contact me is via my email which is [jacobszelko@gmail.com](mailto:jacobszelko@gmail).
Else, I am also available on Twitter at my profile [@jacob_zelko](https://twitter.com/jacob_zelko).
I welcome any inquiry about chatting around common interests, possible collaborations, or consultancy requests.

Please note, if you send me spam or inappropriate inquiries/media, I will block all communications with you.

# Overview:
__Project Status: <span style="color: orange"> Current</span>__ <br>
__Duration: Summer/Fall 2019__ <br>
__Location: Antigua, Guatemala__ <br><br>
*A rigorous investigation and appraisal of the interactions between local Guatemalan healthcare providers in Antigua and visiting surgical teams.*

I will be working with the [NAPA-OT Field School in Antigua Guatemala](http://napaotguatemala.org/) with [Stephanie Roche MPH](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniedroche/) and [Dr. Rachel Hall-Clifford PHD MPH MSC](https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/faculty/rachel-hall-clifford.html) as well as others from across the United States. Furthermore, I will attend the [Tecun Uman Spanish School](https://www.tecunumanschool.edu.gt/) to receive intensive Spanish grammar instruction, live in a Guatemalan home stay, and attend daily lectures on public health from NAPA-OT faculty.

# Project Goals:

The goals of this project are set out by the Field School below:

* To explore the perspectives of Guatemalan health care providers on their experiences with visiting surgical teams in Guatemala

* To understand the processes and participants involved in short-term surgical missions, from patient identification to triage to surgery to post-operative care

* To identify points for strengthened collaboration and process improvement between local providers and visiting surgical teams

* To understand the impacts of humanitarian aid and development paradigms on the Guatemalan health system

* To develop social justice and occupational justice analyses of short-term surgical missions

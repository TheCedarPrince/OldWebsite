# Overview:
__Project Status: <span style="color: blue"> Fundraising</span>__ <br>
__Duration: Summer/Fall 2019__ <br>
__Location: Antigua, Guatemala__ <br><br>
*A rigorous investigation and appraisal of the interactions between local Guatemalan healthcare providers in Antigua and visiting surgical teams.*

I will be working with the [NAPA-OT Field School in Antigua Guatemala](http://napaotguatemala.org/) with [Stephanie Roche MPH](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniedroche/) and [Dr. Rachel Hall-Clifford PHD MPH MSC](https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/faculty/rachel-hall-clifford.html) as well as others from across the United States. Furthermore, I will attend the [Tecun Uman Spanish School](https://www.tecunumanschool.edu.gt/) to receive intensive Spanish grammar instruction, live in a Guatemalan home stay, and attend daily lectures on public health from NAPA-OT faculty.

# Project Details:

This is an excerpted version of the full project detail:

> With only 3 surgical specialists per 100,000 population, the current Guatemalan healthcare system struggles to provide essential surgical care in a reliable and equitable manner. The concentration of surgical specialists in the urban private sector [...] places low-income, rural-dwellin Guatemalans in need of surgery in a precarious situation. In response, [...] foreign surgical specialists [...] engage in short-term medical missions (STMMs), performing surgeries during in-country stays of about 1 to 2 weeks. These volunteers are often supported by local providers who carry out pre- and post-operative evaluations and lead, co-lead, or assist with the surgery itself. <br><br>The quality, efficiency, and continuity of STMM care depends, in large part, on the interactions between local and visiting providers. [...] In this project, we will interview local providers about what they see as the benefits and drawbacks of this care delivery model as well as areas for improvement. [...] <br><br>__*Understanding whether and how this care delivery model supports local health workforce is critical given global healthâ€™s current emphasis on health system strengthening.*__

# Project Goals:

The goals of this project are set out by the Field School below:

* To explore the perspectives of Guatemalan health care providers on their experiences with visiting surgical teams in Guatemala

* To understand the processes and participants involved in short-term surgical missions, from patient identification to triage to surgery to post-operative care

* To identify points for strengthened collaboration and process improvement between local providers and visiting surgical teams

* To understand the impacts of humanitarian aid and development paradigms on the Guatemalan health system

* To develop social justice and occupational justice analyses of short-term surgical missions

# Hello! | ¡Hola! | !مرحبا

### My Name Is Jacob S. Zelko -- Pleasure To Meet You! :wave:
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a graduate of [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/) with a BS in biomedical engineering.
While pursuing my BS, I worked as a data information specialist and biomedical informaticist in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University](http://www.bmi.emory.edu/) doing research in the areas of computational psychiatry and worked with [The Center for Discovery](https://thecenterfordiscovery.org/) as an engineering consultant to aid in caring for their juvenile neurocognitively diverse population.
Furthermore, I am an amateur medical anthropologist having worked in rural Guatemala with the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology to examine health systems strengthening and resource constrained environments. 

### What Am I Passionate About?
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the social determinants of health, resource constrained environments, neurocognitive disabilities, mental health, equitable healthcare, reproducible science, open source science, knowledge management, and education.
Additionally, as a [practicing Christian](/blog/faith/), I am very interested in the intersection of faith communities and science.
More technically, I develop open source scientific software using Julia and Python to analyze medical datasets to produce performant analysis pipelines and visualization schemes.
I use my [blog](/posts/) to share on my thoughts on anything ranging from programming and knowledge management to academia and best practices.

For information about ongoing projects, please visit my [Projects](/projects/) page. 

### Any Hobbies?
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a multi-instrumentalist; I am heavily influenced by acts like Caspian and Hammock and composers such as Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson.
A short film I scored was even nominated for the [Cannes Short Film Corner](/projects/2018-09-20-Its Different/) at the Cannes festival!

I also host an [educational Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince) where I work on open source coding and research projects.
I use this outlet to teach best practices in software engineering, how to program, and development workflows.

# Hello! | ¡Hola! | !مرحبا

### My Name Is Jacob S. Zelko -- Pleasure To Meet You! :wave:
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a graduate of [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/) with a BS in biomedical engineering.
I currently work at [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) in the Health Emerging and Advanced Technologies division (HEAT-D) as a Health Data Analytics and Informatics Researcher as well as being a Contractor for the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).
I am a transplant to Atlanta, Georgia from Upstate New York! 

### What Am I Passionate About?
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the social determinants of health, resource constrained environments, neurocognitive disabilities, mental health, equitable healthcare, reproducible science, open source science, knowledge management, and education.
Additionally, as a [practicing Christian](/faith/), I am very interested in the intersection of faith communities and science.
More technically, I develop open source scientific software using Julia and Python to analyze medical datasets to produce performant analysis pipelines and visualization schemes.
I use my [blog](/posts/) to share on my thoughts on anything ranging from programming and knowledge management to academia and best practices.

For information about ongoing projects, please visit my [Projects](/projects/) page. 

### Any Hobbies?
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a multi-instrumentalist; I am heavily influenced by acts like Caspian and Hammock and composers such as Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson.
A short film I scored was even nominated for the [Cannes Short Film Corner](/projects/2018-09-20-Its Different/) at the Cannes festival!

I also host an [educational Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince) where I work on open source coding and research projects.
I use this outlet to teach best practices in software engineering, how to program, and development workflows.

Also, for fun, I am trying to pick up Stenography to write quicker using a hobbyist stenography machine. :keyboard:

<em>A rigorous investigation and appraisal of the interactions between local Guatemalan healthcare providers in Antigua and visiting surgical teams.</em></p>

<p>I will be working with the <a href="http://napaotguatemala.org/">NAPA-OT Field School in Antigua Guatemala</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniedroche/">Stephanie Roche MPH</a> and <a href="https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/faculty/rachel-hall-clifford.html">Dr. Rachel Hall-Clifford PHD MPH MSC</a> as well as others from across the United States. Furthermore, I will attend the <a href="https://www.tecunumanschool.edu.gt/">Tecun Uman Spanish School</a> to receive intensive Spanish grammar instruction, live in a Guatemalan home stay, and attend daily lectures on public health from NAPA-OT faculty.</p>

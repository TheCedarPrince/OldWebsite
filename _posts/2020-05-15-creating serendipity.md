Is it a flash of insight while laying in bed about how to handle a problem? A scientist screaming, "Eureka!" at the top of their lungs? The idea of a seemingly random, positive outcome occurring seems only that: random. I believe this is not entirely true.

# Zettelkasten

## Selecting Information for a Zettel

- Does this not add to the overall nature of the Zettelkasten? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 78]
- What sort of topics could this open in the Zettelkasten? Are these topics you are willing to invest into? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 78]
- Where does this new note possibly fit into in the rest of the conversation with your Zettelkasten? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 78]
- Can this information be added to an already existing Zettel or theme? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 98]

## Zettel Creation

- Do you have enough information do write a new zettel? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 97]
- Do you understand the information enough in the zettel you are creating? @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 98]
- Each Zettel should fit onto a screen.  @ahrensHowTakeSmart2017 [p. 120]

## Principles of the Zettelkasten

[@clearZettelkastenHowOne2020]

1. "Principle of Atomicity" -- each zettel should contain only one idea (principle credited to Christian Tietze).

2. Each zettel should be self-contained and understandable as a standalone scrap of thought.

3. Link each zettel and explain why you are linking them together.

4. Reword gathered information in your own words (unless if it is a verbatim quote or something).

6. Add references to each zettel.

7. Don't be afraid to add your own ideas to the Zettelkasten -- embrace it.

8. Have no fear when it comes to organization -- the order will arise organically in the Zettelkasten.

9. Never delete a zettel and don't worry too much about when you create zettels; the more information the better.

10. Don't overthink the Zettelkasten. Keep it simple and efficient.

## Niklas Luhmann's Card Index: The Fabrication of Serendipity

J. F. K. Schmidt, Niklas Luhmann's Card Index: The Fabrication of Serendipity, Sociologica, vol. Vol 12, pp. 53-60 Pages, Jul. 2018, doi: 10.6092/ISSN.1971-8853/8350.

> "As early as in the 1950s to 1960s, Luhmann simulated a modern computer-based database system [...]." (pg. 59)

I actually think that the Zettelkasten method by Luhmann is distinctly different from a computer database. The reason being, is that this is far more overlapping and far reaching than a discrete system like a simple computer database. One could argue that relations could be made analogous to relational databases but here, the relations are far more abstract than they are in the traditional relational database. If anything, Luhmann's Zettelkasten is more similar to a graph-type system - such as a knowledge graph - than a database 

> "Luhmann's card index allows the production of new and often unexpected knowledge by relating concepts and thoughts that do not have much in common at first sight [...] [I]t makes [...] serendipity possible in a systemically and theoretically informed way." (pg. 54)

The power of the Zettelkasten comes from these accidental connections. Very similar to how one may spread out pieces of paper on a table and make a new connection, so does this method simulate it in very much the same way.

Luhmann employed ambiguity and indecisiveness into the development of the Zettelkasten approach whenever he added a new piece of information to the Zettelkasten. Rather than assigning the piece of information to one discrete category, he enabled that piece of info to naturally attach itself to other pieces of information as [knowledge falls across a spectrum.](03092020022908-education-spectrum.md) (pg. 56)

## Weekly Planning in a Bullet Journal

@HowMakeSIMPLE @BulletJournalBasicsb

The weekly plan is very similar to the [monthly plan](03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md) but is on a much smaller scale. If anything, it is much more similar to a weekly planner with an added twist of being an exercise in reflection and journaling. The weekly plan comprises of two main parts being:

1. Preview - where you plan for the week ahead
2. Review - where you reflect on the previous week

### Layout

Generally, it is very brief and contains the following:

1. Major to-do's of the week
2. Major events of the week marked on corresponding day
3. Review of the previous week in a short form journal

Also, one could also include something like a [habit tracking system](03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md) for each week as well.

### Preview

Here is encompassed the first two points being:

1. Major to-do's of the week
2. Major events of the week marked on corresponding day

This is where you schedule each day of the week based on your schedule. One can use the ["Next Actions" and "Waiting For"](03192020050207-gtd-implementation.md) list from the [GTD framework](03192020045854-get-things-done.md) to plan out your to-do's in a much more structured and useful way.

### Review

Here is where the last point of the layout comes in - a reflection in the form of a [short form journal](03192020035441-bullet-journal-daily.md##Short-Form-Journaling-Symbols). This is meant to be a brief professional reflection on the week and to reflect on the:

- Wins for the week
- What could have been better
- How you are going to improve next week

## GTD Definition

@GTD15Minutes

GTD, or _Getting Things Done_, is a productivity framework created by David Allen to free your mind from as much additional load as possible while maintaining projects, lists, and other items pertaining to day-to-day operations. 

## GTD Implementation

@GTD15Minutes @benzBulletJournalGTD2016

GTD consists of utilizing lists to break down information as it enters your brain. Here are the main lists used:

1. **The Intake** - this is raw information that may come in from your colleagues, class, or situation.

2. **Projects** - this contains what projects you have going on

3. **Next Actions** - tasks that require immediate or imminent volition go here

4. **Waiting For** - tasks that you delegate or are waiting on others to accomplish

5. **Future List** - tasks or ideas that may be a stretch at the current moment but worth revisiting

## Implementation Flow Chart

It can be somewhat confusing to parse the intake; this flow diagram shows and easy to use method of how to break down information:

## Trigger List

@quinnUseWeeklyReview

A trigger list is a list of key terms that as you read through them, should remind or "trigger" a thought of something that you perhaps forgot or did not remember pertaining to your life.

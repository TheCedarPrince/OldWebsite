For me, my solution has been to use a very handy tool called **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)** and in this post, I will introduce you to setting it up to manage your personal research and how to use zotero.org to share findings with your team. Buckle up! :sunglasses:

### But, Why Zotero?
{: style="text-align: center;"}

After reviewing reference management tools like EndNote and Mendeley, I came to the conclusion that they are either

1. Too costly

2. Locks you into their app and software ecosystem

3. Not easy to share cross platform

**Whereas Zotero is free, open-source, and is available for Windows, OSX, and Linux!** :smiley:

&nbsp;
### Setting Up Zotero
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Here is the step-by-step on how to set-up Zotero:

1. Navigate to **[zotero.org](https://zotero.org)** and click the button that says, **"Download"** and then **install it** for your appropriate system. 

&nbsp;

</figure>

{:start="2"}
2. Go back to **[zotero.org](https://zotero.org)** and **sign up for a free account** - you can do this also by clicking **[here](https://www.zotero.org/user/register)**.

3. Once you have finished making an account, open Zotero and add in the credentials you made on the website by clicking **Edit>Preferences>Sync**.

### ZotFile - Super Powers for Zotero (and You!)
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Once you have installed Zotero, we are now going to give it super powers to automatically extract the important information from a paper and save it into Zotero.

&nbsp;

<figure class="align-center">

  <figcaption>When you drop a random paper PDF into Zotero, it automatically extracts info with ZotFile.<br> Just like magic :sparkles:</figcaption>
</figure>

&nbsp;

1. Install [ZotFile](zotfile.com) from their website. This will download a .xpi file on your computer.

2. Install ZotFile into Zotero by going to **Tools>Select>Add-ons**. In the menu that shows up, click the **gear icon** and click **"Install Add-on from File"**.

&nbsp;

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/zotfile_install.gif' | absolute_url }}" alt="">
  <figcaption>Make sure to restart Zotero after the install! </figcaption>
</figure>

&nbsp;

3. Select the .xpi you downloaded and install it.

4. Restart Zotero.

ZotFile also allows you to extract comments and annotations from a PDF that you work on later. To do this, right click a file that you have annotated and uploaded to Zotero. Under "Manage Attachments", click "Extract Annotations". Wait for a moment and you should see your annotations pop up under your entry in Zotero as a note file!

&nbsp;

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/zotfile_annotation.gif' | absolute_url }}" alt="">
  <figcaption>Here ZotFile automagically copies the annotations from a PDF and stores them into Zotero for easy referencing.</figcaption>

### Zotero for Teams
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Communicating files to your team members is easy with Zotero Sync! Here is how to do it:

1. Go back to **[zotero.org](https://zotero.org)** and **login to your profile**. Click where the layout says **"Groups"**. 

2. Here you can easily create a new group be clicking "Create a New Group" - once you do this, you can create a group with specific permissions; it is up to you to decide!

&nbsp;

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/zotero_groups.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt="">
  <figcaption>You have a few options with creating a group - choose wisely!</figcaption>
</figure>

&nbsp;

{:start="3"}
3. Once inside your group, you can add members via their email or Zotero username and add in findings you wish to share with your group. 

4. **You can also add documents within Zotero to share with your group.** Open Zotero and wait for Zotero to sync. You should see a new list pop-up called **"Group Libraries" with your newly made group**. Drop in whatever files you wish and your **team should see the file pop up on their Zotero accounts after sync is complete!**

&nbsp;

  <figcaption>If I click on any of my group libraries, I can see and interact with all the items shared in the group.</figcaption>

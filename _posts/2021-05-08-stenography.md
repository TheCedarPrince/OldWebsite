_Learning to write 200+ WPM with stenography_
{: .notice}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

1. Learn the stenographic keyboard layout
    - Maintaining proper posture
    - How to chord correctly
    - Arpeggiating
    - Layout philosophy & approaches
2. Approaching Stenography theory
    - Exploring what is a stenographic theory
    - Familiarize self with types of theories
    - Weigh pros and cons of existing theories
    - Select Theory to practice
3. Study selected theory
    - Learn briefs
    - Phrasing


 Eh, Just learn Plover's theory, unless you feel like spending money. You can probably switch any time within the first couple months (or later, with more effort).
Not really, I think there are dictionaries of some other theories online...
[12:22 PM] fplt: Perhaps the main issue is that you actually have to learn the theory to know which one is better/worse but...
[12:22 PM] fplt: The basic is mostly the same in all theories. (which chord for which sound)

Your overall plan looks good, you might end up doing a few things at the same time which is cool, just let that happen if so. 
And yeah, doing foundation stuff first is a good idea i would say, become familiar with steno and how to use it, how to sit... Etc 
Don't expect to look up works and write straight away, keep steno just for learning and not practical use initially. That way when you do get to writing properly you know you're doing it well

...it is okay for this to take a while to learn, it's brand new muscle memory and layout and all sorts of things.

 What is conflict-free theory?

 it just means the output is deterministic and unambiguous - for each stroke you write there's only one possible translation
if I want conflict-free I'll go learn Velotype
[8:03 PM] SKWREPB: many theories (especially older ones) have conflicts and you'll need to learn how to resolve ambiguous outlines
[8:03 PM] SKWREPB: but with more emphasis on realtime newer theories tend to be conflict free

the engine is conflict-free in the sense that if you assign SAEUL to "sale" it'll always produce "sale" and not "sail"
[8:06 PM] β1 (PWA*ET/#S): but you have to pick something else to assign to "sail"
[8:06 PM] SKWREPB: the theory has to be designed that way too of course :sweat_smile:
[8:06 PM] β1 (PWA*ET/#S): yeah
[8:07 PM] β1 (PWA*ET/#S): I would say Plover is a conflict-free engine but not a conflict-free theory
[8:07 PM] SKWREPB: which is why I made that distinction earlier
[8:08 PM] SKWREPB: Plover theory isn't 100% conflict free

I think allowing some conflicts is the price one pays for writing shorter
[8:09 PM] SKWREPB: I think it's already as close as you can get - and certainly for a free theory it's really good at that
[8:09 PM] JorWat (SKWROR/WAT): Thanks to pairs of words like 'lighten gauge' and 'light engage', making something genuinely conflict free is basically impossible.
[8:09 PM] β1 (PWA*ET/#S): well, honestly any homophone pair will do that to you
[8:09 PM] SKWREPB: I say learn Plover first and see if you like it, then pick up a different theory in the future if you really want to

Oh yea? What is wrong with arpeggiating? Why wouldn't you spend time on it?
[12:30 PM] JorWat (SKWROR/WAT): It's a stopgap feature only included for people without NKRO keyboards.
[12:31 PM] Kaoffie (KA*T/KWREU): It might lead to bad habits when you start chording

 TheCedarPrince: Ah gotcha. And what are the differences between phrasing and briefs? I actually thought they were quite similar.
[12:33 PM] crides (KR*EUDZ): Briefs are not spelling the phonetics out
[12:33 PM] JorWat (SKWROR/WAT): Briefs are entries that are shorter than the phonetic entries.
[12:33 PM] crides (KR*EUDZ): phrasing is just cramming phrases into chords
[12:33 PM] crides (KR*EUDZ): Phrasing doesn't even have to do with phonetics really

I think in light of what everyone has been saying, putting in a section on like, what you need for steno (software, hardware) would be good
[1:07 PM] JorWat (SKWROR/WAT): Suitable hardware seems pretty key, as I'm trying to get started without it while I'm waiting for a proper keyboard to arrive, and I'm really limited in what I can do.
[1:19 PM] Jesse (TallyHawk): I would add that getting even a cheapo gaming mechanical keyboard that is staggered is a great way to get started practicing (and something like this can be useful, even if you end up dropping the hobby) - this plus some G20s was perfect for me... at least until I could get an ortho keyboard.
e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X3DWPZS
[1:21 PM] Kaito: eye-dropping
[1:22 PM] Jesse (TallyHawk): Also, I think focusing too much on theory probably isn't required. I ended up learning phoenix theory, but starting with plover and getting familiar with the positions of the keys and chording in general is good enough to really get a feel for steno. I ended up liking phoenix theory more, but that probably has more to do with the structure of the lessons in the book, than it has to do with the theory itself.
[1:22 PM] dnaq: @Jesse (TallyHawk) can you describe what you like and don’t like with Phoenix?
[1:23 PM] dnaq: I’ve been thinking about buying the magnum and Phoenix books, but I’ll have to ship them overseas.
[1:27 PM] Jesse (TallyHawk): Like I said, it probably has more to do with the lessons in the book (which have a very school lesson type structure). I couldn't get into a pattern of practicing and learning the structure of plover, and all the "why is this word chorded like this". I thought a lot of it was random, but having gone through a good chunk of these books, I realize there's always concessions, and it's potentially more about how you are introduced to and learning the different nuances / patterns
[1:29 PM] Jesse (TallyHawk): I could say that Phoenix is more structured and consistent, but I'm still going through the books (very very slowly), and I never committed enough to Plover Theory to confidently comment on it.
[1:37 PM] dnaq: Structured lessons might be a good thing in itself
[1:37 PM] dnaq: And I know that I won’t ever reach court reporters speeds ( And won’t ever need to)
[1:38 PM] dnaq: So that makes getting the Phoenix books more interesting in itself. But I would also like to read the magnum books to contrast them with each other
[1:39 PM] Jesse (TallyHawk): I know Magnum is supposed to be brief heavy, and I personally wasn't interested in the memorization aspect. For me, the piece-by-piece stroking for Phoenix was much more appealing, and for the most part that's very true.

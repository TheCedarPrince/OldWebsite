*Code is a language - why are we not taught how to explain it?*

- Poor code base documentation.

- Package conflicts.

- Irreproducibility of projects.

Any of these send an ***all-too-familiar*** shiver up your spine?

Anyone can learn Python, Java, or C but those are not what is really important in work environments. **Rather, what is most important is effectively communicating your idea with code as its medium.**

Remembering back to programming classes, I do not recall being taught how to communicate ideas through code. It is more along the lines of "do the thing" - your only audience may be an automatic grader or harried TAs grading hundreds of other assignments. 

### *This begs the question: <br> <br> Given that coding is a language, why are we not trained to explain it?*

#  My Response - Coding for Communication Series
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In response to some issues that I have noticed through my time working as a software engineer, I created the **Coding for Communication Series**. This series is for the seasoned programmer as well as the beginner. Here are my general suggestions about working through this series: 

- Basic knowledge of the commandline (whether that is on Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Very basic knowledge of programming

And above all, a relentlessly curiousity.

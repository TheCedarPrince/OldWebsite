*My workflow for capturing, storing, and sharing information from a personal knowledge base.*

<span class="dropcap" style="float: left; font-size: 55px; line-height: 1; margin-right: 5px; height: 50px;">A<span style="display: inline; height: 66px;"></span></span> common trend that I have found over the past few years while working alongside academics is that there is no easy way to capture, store, and share information relevant to projects or research - this being most bitter of ironies as ***science is built on collaboration.***

Over the past couple years, I have developed a method of capturing information, storing it alongside notes or annotations, and having it be shareable to others. **Outlined below is my method for building your own knowledge base workflow.**



If videos are not your thing, I have written up the general procedure for getting everything set up below for how I work.

&nbsp;
##  Knowledge Base Criteria
{: style="text-align: center;"}

My personal criteria for a good knowledge base is that it must:

1. **Cost as little as possible** - whether you are a student or a professional, it is always great to save money where possible

2. **Be platform independent** - whether you are on OSX, Linux, Android, or Windows, you can access the materials across all these different platforms *<u>easily</u>*

3. **Has some redundancy and back-ups** - NOTHING is worse than having your computer, tablet, or phone die, break, or get stolen; having safety measures to provide back-ups is a must

4. **Allows for flexibility and creative solutions** - I never want to be tied down to any particular ecosystem because I operate under the assumption that I may wake up one morning and that software or app is not supported anymore

5. **Does it get the job done, easily?** - one can come up with a great solution, but if it takes you 30 minutes to process a paper into your workflow, that is not going to cut it

&nbsp;
## My Workflow
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**If you want to copy my workflow, go through each section individually starting with the first one - reference management.** Otherwise, my system is broken into five different parts as follows - feel free to click on each category to jump ahead by clicking the headers below:

**Reference Mangement** - organizing all those pdfs, papers, and scribblings in notepad

**Reading & Annotation Software** - I always take notes on things I read - can't live without it!

**Cloud Storage** - the cloud is here to save the day!

**Mobile Access** - sometimes I read papers while in line for hot chocolate at starbucks...

**Sharing & Collaboration** - science is not a bubble

### Reference Management

  <figcaption>Zotero is the Hero!</figcaption>

After reviewing reference management tools like EndNote and Mendeley, I came to the conclusion that they are either

A) Too costly

B) Locks you into their app and software ecosystem

C) Not easy to share cross platform

Therefore, I came to the conclusion that **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is the best reference manager out there that meets my requirements.** The process to get started with Zotero is pretty [straightforward](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) and there are a plethora of tutorials available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zotero+set-up) and the [Zotero documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/) is extremely extensive!

What I like most about Zotero is its flexibility and that the entire code base is open source. There is a thriving community around Zotero that is actively developing it, creating extensions and lobbying new ideas - everything that I want to see in an open source software. :smiley:

Once you have followed one of the tutorials, I would suggest you install [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com) into Zotero. It can be a little tricky to configure so let me walk you through it.

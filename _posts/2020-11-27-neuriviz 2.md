In [Part 1 of NeuriViz](/neuriviz-1/) project updates, I laid out the purpose and general approach I am taking to creating neuroscientific visualizations.
The first visualization I had the goal of creating was an EEG topoplot inspired by such projects like [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) and [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).
I am happy to say that, after writing this in pure Julia, that this goal has now been achieved!

The following sections takes you through how I accomplished this!
